                    <p>
                        From now on we advice any miners on this pool to add <span class="monocolored">--submit-stale</span> to their
                        ccminer-tpruvot / ccminer v2.2.5 command line. Since this pool sends out more frequent work-updates,
                        while only discarding old work when the network actually finds a new block, it seems that ccminer's stale job
                        checks prevent it from sending otherwise valid shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that changing this setting might decrease your valid share ratio, but you will find more valid shares overall,
                        therefore receive higher payouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This looks to be (one of) the main causes of the hashrate issues we have seen on this pool. It is unclear to
                        me whether this also affects mining on other pools, as I don't know the exact checks ccminer uses here. At any rate,
                        the effect of not using this option on this pool should be a lot higher than on others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that if you are using other mining software or are using the <i>nanashi</i> ccminer fork, you do not have to change anything.

                        The is a quick update to make people aware that this pool is now ready for the upcoming hard-fork
                        scheduled to occur after block <span class="monocolored">58670</span>, expected around <em>19:00 GMT on the 16th</em>.

                        We are now running an a fork-enabled Garlicoin Core node and stand ready to switch the pool over
                        to the new hashing algorithm on a moments notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are planning to take the pool offline after block <span class="monocolored">58660</span> and get the new pool up as soon as possible,
                        expecting this to happen minutes before the actual fork occurs. This should give everyone enough time
                        to update their miners and re-connect, this so we can start mining for <em><i>Allium</i></em> as soon as block
                        <span class="monocolored">58670</span> is found.

                        another pool at that time.

                    <p>
                        This is just a quick heads-up to say I wrote a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/garlicoin/comments/7wvrxx/psa_when_is_a_hash_not_a_hash_or_how_you_should/">reddit post</a>
                        with more information about tests I did with different versions of ccminer and how you should not trust the miner-reported
                        hashrate without also having a look at the hashrate the pool reports.

                    <p>
                        One of the complaints I still get from time to time is that the reported hashrate one
                        this website is lower than it should be. Some miners therefore decide to go to other
                        pools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since the new rolling-average hashrate estimation has been implemented, I feel
                        that the hashrate calculations should be pretty precise (once they have fully stabilized
                        after a few hours) and I have therefore also removed the warning/disclaimer we used
                        to have on the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, it is still true that the hashrate estimations are only used within the website's
                        UI. Payout is 100% based on shares sent to the pool. The main issue here however, is that if
                        the reported hashrate is lower than expected, it is probably being caused by the fact that
                        less shares are being send to the pool than otherwise would be the case, hence the pool's
                        hashrate estimation (based on those shares), as well as miner reward payout, is lower than
                        expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, it is of course easy to say that the pool is somehow showing incorrect information or maybe
                        even ignoring some shares send by the miner, therefore reducing both the estimated hashrate
                        as well as payouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To counter these claims, and in an attempt at full transparency, we do now have a special page
                        that can be used to test and verify the pool's processing of your submitted shares. That way,
                        you can verify that the pool is correctly processing all the shares you sent in and therefore
                        rewarding you correctly based on the work you are actually doing (i.e. if you are randomly hashing,
                        but for example generating a lot of hardware errors, therefore not doing a lot of actual work,
                        there is no reason for the pool to reward you for the work you did not do).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully, this page will clear things up and lead to one of the following conclusions with
                        relation to why you are maybe paid less than you thought you would:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your miner is fine, but the pool had a period of bad luck (this is now verifiable using the new luck graphs).</li>
                            <li>Your miner is fine, but it itself had a peiod of bad luck (hence it was sending in less shares than expected).</li>
                            <li>There is an actual issue with your mining setup and you might be able to tweak it by changing (for example) intensity settings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The page is available through the 'My worker' tab. You can run the test without having to stop
                        mining at the pool, as it just analyses pool worker data. You do however need access to your mining
                        software (i.e. you - typically - can't do this remotely), as you will need to verify the pool's share
                        counter using the share counter within your miner software.

                    <p>
                        The pool has been restarted to apply a small fix to the pool's luck data gathering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might have noticed that some datapoints are missing in the luck graphs. This was
                        caused by the data gatherer sometimes missing the end of the capture window, therefore
                        combining multiple measurement windows into a single datapoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that this does not make the luck graphs incorrect, just somewhat imprecise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This issue has now been fixed and new data should no longer have this flaw.

                        When Garlicoin mainnet launched and both the network as a whole as well as this pool got a lot more traction
                        than expected, a lot of changes had to be made in a short time.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    Everyone's shares will decrease by 90% if the pool finds a block<br />
                    (except when multiple blocks are found within a small amount of time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shares decrease by 5% whenever anyone finds a new block on the network<br />
                    (this happens more or less every 41 seconds).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Workers under the minimum share floor of 8 shares don't get paid,<br />
                    but are also not affected by the 5% share decrease<br />
                    (this to decrease the amount of dust the pool is generating somewhat).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is all part of the payout management logic in order to keep payout fair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that this does not mean that the pool takes a fee by decreasing worker shares,<br />
                    as shares are the only thing on which block reward payout is based. Rather,<br />
                    this is a way to get workers that stopped mining slowly out of the system<br />
                    while still giving them something for their work.<br />
                    It also helps new workers joining to pool to get a little bit extra in times<br />
                    where the pool is unlucky and can't find a block for a while.
                </p>
