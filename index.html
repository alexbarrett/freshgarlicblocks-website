                    <p>
                        As a lot of people are probably aware of by now, last night we experienced a glitch in the daily payout processor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Probably caused by a off-by-one error in the block maturity test (full investigation is still pending), more than 90% of
                        payouts got cancelled by the final verification and sanity checking code due to an incorrect transaction amount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the mean time I have manually initiated another payment round, which executed successfully. This means a small amount
                        of miners received payment twice (where the second time only payout for the work since the last payout was included).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More information will follow as soon as the root cause if the payout issue is found. I will keep a close eye
                        on the daily payouts and manually request another round in case we experience another failure.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div style="text-align: left">
                    <span class="date">16-02-2018</span><span class="smallheading">Daily payments are here!</span>
                    <p>
                        While everyone is anxiously waiting for the hard-fork to occur, we have other big news: By popular demand, we bring you
                        daily payments!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have had a lot of people ask if it would be possible to set a certain treshold for payout, similar to how other pools
                        handle payout. However, we are not like other pools! The big thing that makes this pool different is that it does not
                        collect your block reward. Instead it crafts the blocks in such a way that your rewards are sent to you without the pool
                        ever even touching them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With daily payout, we find a middle ground. Instead of directly sending you your part of the block reward, it gets collected
                        in a personal consolidation address managed by the pool. Once every day, all your rewards are then sent to you in one
                        transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This last part will require a small fee. However, this fee should in almost all circumstances be (way) less than the fees
                        other pools ask for. Still too much? Just keep using the instant payout instead. All this is just another option for miners
                        who are interested!
                    </p>

                    <span class="date">13-02-2018</span><span class="smallheading">Advised to add --submit-stale to ccminer-tpruvot command</span>
                    <p>
                        From now on we advice any miners on this pool to add <span class="monocolored">--submit-stale</span> to their
                        ccminer-tpruvot / ccminer v2.2.5 command line. Since this pool sends out more frequent work-updates,
                        while only discarding old work when the network actually finds a new block, it seems that ccminer's stale job
                        checks prevent it from sending otherwise valid shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that changing this setting might decrease your valid share ratio, but you will find more valid shares overall,
                        therefore receive higher payouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This looks to be (one of) the main causes of the hashrate issues we have seen on this pool. It is unclear to
                        me whether this also affects mining on other pools, as I don't know the exact checks ccminer uses here. At any rate,
                        the effect of not using this option on this pool should be a lot higher than on others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that if you are using other mining software or are using the <i>nanashi</i> ccminer fork, you do not have to change anything.

                        The is a quick update to make people aware that this pool is now ready for the upcoming hard-fork
                        scheduled to occur after block <span class="monocolored">58670</span>, expected around <em>19:00 GMT on the 16th</em>.

                        We are now running an a fork-enabled Garlicoin Core node and stand ready to switch the pool over
                        to the new hashing algorithm on a moments notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are planning to take the pool offline after block <span class="monocolored">58660</span> and get the new pool up as soon as possible,
                        expecting this to happen minutes before the actual fork occurs. This should give everyone enough time
                        to update their miners and re-connect, this so we can start mining for <em><i>Allium</i></em> as soon as block
                        <span class="monocolored">58670</span> is found.

                        Miners that don't want to loose out on a chance to get the blocks in between should make sure they join
                        another pool at that time.

                    <p>
                        This is just a quick heads-up to say I wrote a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/garlicoin/comments/7wvrxx/psa_when_is_a_hash_not_a_hash_or_how_you_should/">reddit post</a>
                        with more information about tests I did with different versions of ccminer and how you should not trust the miner-reported
                        hashrate without also having a look at the hashrate the pool reports.
                    </p>

                        See the post itself for more info.

                </div>
                <div style="text-align: left">
                    <span class="date">08-02-2018</span><span class="smallheading">Pool hashrate verification test available</span>
                    <p>
                        One of the complaints I still get from time to time is that the reported hashrate one
                        this website is lower than it should be. Some miners therefore decide to go to other
                        pools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since the new rolling-average hashrate estimation has been implemented, I feel
                        that the hashrate calculations should be pretty precise (once they have fully stabilized
                        after a few hours) and I have therefore also removed the warning/disclaimer we used
                        to have on the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, it is still true that the hashrate estimations are only used within the website's
                        UI. Payout is 100% based on shares sent to the pool. The main issue here however, is that if
                        the reported hashrate is lower than expected, it is probably being caused by the fact that
                        less shares are being send to the pool than otherwise would be the case, hence the pool's
                        hashrate estimation (based on those shares), as well as miner reward payout, is lower than
                        expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, it is of course easy to say that the pool is somehow showing incorrect information or maybe
                        even ignoring some shares send by the miner, therefore reducing both the estimated hashrate
                        as well as payouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To counter these claims, and in an attempt at full transparency, we do now have a special page
                        that can be used to test and verify the pool's processing of your submitted shares. That way,
                        you can verify that the pool is correctly processing all the shares you sent in and therefore
                        rewarding you correctly based on the work you are actually doing (i.e. if you are randomly hashing,
                        but for example generating a lot of hardware errors, therefore not doing a lot of actual work,
                        there is no reason for the pool to reward you for the work you did not do).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully, this page will clear things up and lead to one of the following conclusions with
                        relation to why you are maybe paid less than you thought you would:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your miner is fine, but the pool had a period of bad luck (this is now verifiable using the new luck graphs).</li>
                            <li>Your miner is fine, but it itself had a peiod of bad luck (hence it was sending in less shares than expected).</li>
                            <li>There is an actual issue with your mining setup and you might be able to tweak it by changing (for example) intensity settings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The page is available through the 'My worker' tab. You can run the test without having to stop
                        mining at the pool, as it just analyses pool worker data. You do however need access to your mining
                        software (i.e. you - typically - can't do this remotely), as you will need to verify the pool's share
                        counter using the share counter within your miner software.

                    <p>
                        You might have noticed that some datapoints are missing in the luck graphs. This was
                        caused by the data gatherer sometimes missing the end of the capture window, therefore
                        combining multiple measurement windows into a single datapoint.

                    <p>
                        Note that this does not make the luck graphs incorrect, just somewhat imprecise.

                        We have a new website layout!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The original website was only made with 20 - 30 workers in mind and a hardcoded limit of 100 workers.<br />
                        When Garlicoin mainnet launched and both the network as a whole as well as this pool got a lot more traction
                        than expected, a lot of changes had to be made in a short time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the final changes, and overhaul of this website, is now complete: Have a look around!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from the overal design (and the same shitty style ;-) , the main features are pool luck graphs
                        and an easier way to view worker statistics.

                <h1>How to mine on the FreshGRLC.net pool</h1>
                <div style="text-align: left;">
                    <span class="smallheading">Mining at FreshGRLC.net: 2 options</span><br />
                    <p>
                        Right now we offer 2 ways of mining at this pool. Or rather, we offer to types of payment:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Instant payout</li>
                            <li>Daily payout</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instant payout is what made this pool special from the very beginning. You directly get a part of the block's
                        miners reward (and transaction fees). <br />
                        Basically, you are "solo-mining together" and that against 0% fee. Simple and no bamboozle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since mid-Februari, we also offer daily payouts. This is a way to reduce the amount of Unspent
                        Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in your wallet, therefore making it cheaper to send coins to other people
                        down the line. With daily payouts you still get a part of the block's mining reward, but instead of
                        directly sending it to your wallet address, it is send to a personal consolidation address managed by
                        the pool. Once a day, all your rewards are consolidated using a special low fee
                        (typically less than 0.1%, in a lot of cases only a fraction of that) and sent to your payout address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can choose whichever payment method you like most and configure your worker to use it using
                        the instructions below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="smallerheading"><b>NOTE</b></span><br />
                        Because of how the pool works and combines multiple workers together based on their address,
                        the pool will only set your chosen payment method when it first registers your worker.<br />
                        This means that if you want to change payment method you either have to stop mining and wait until your
                        worker does no longer appear on the Workers list tab, or change your payout address so your miner can
                        register itself as a new worker.
                    </p>

                    <span class="smallheading">Our bread and (garlic-) butter: Instant payout</span><br />
                    <p>
                        You can mine at our pool by simply connecting with your mining software to our pool's stratum server,
                        using your wallet address as username. This will set up your worker for instant payout, in other words:
                        you get paid whenever we find a block. Instantaneous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using this method, the pool does not even touch your earnings once. Instead you get a part of the raw miners reward.
                        Ideal if you have difficulty trusting pool owners: You see the pool finding a block? You see a transaction in your wallet.
                        Usually (if you use a proper wallet), you will receive the transaction notification even before the pool lists the block as found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This method is also easiest to set up.
                        For the 3 most popular miners, <em>ccminer</em>, <em>sgminer</em> and <em>cpuminer</em>, you would use a command (or BAT file line)
                        that looks something like this:

                    <span class="smallheading">Yesterday's Garlic: Daily payout</span><br />
                    <p>
                        As an alternative to instant payout, we offer daily payout. With daily payout all your mining rewards go to a special personal consolidation address
                        managed by the pool. Once a day, at 20:00 GMT, the pool will schedule a low-fee payout from this address to your payout wallet address, thereby
                        combining all your rewards into a single transaction. The payout transaction will then be processed/confirmed in the next few blocks the pool finds
                        (typically within an hour).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea of this payout method is that it is fully transparent, since everything happens on the blockchain. You can check your per-block
                        mining reward using the pool's website and verify it to some extend based on your hashrate. When the pool finds a block you can directly view
                        your mining reward being sent to your consolidation address on the blockchain. From there, you would notice if anyone (including the pool)
                        tried to steal it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that all this requires a small fee. This fee is used for the actual consolidation transaction and does not go to the pool owner.
                        Instead it is handled as any other fee and therefore shared between all the miners on this pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This fee is typically between 0.0% and 0.1%. Fees of 0.01% are normal for standard GPU mining. To get an idea of the consolidation fee,
                        check the My worker tab.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to use daily payouts, follow the same steps as for instant payout, but instead of just using your payout address as username,
                        prepend it with <em>daily-</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we apply this to the examples listed above under instant payout, they would become:

                        <i>If you use the Garlicoin Core GUI (a.k.a. garlicoin-qt), you can import your personal consolidation address as a watch-only address.
                           That way you will still get a notification whenever the pool find a block and immediately see your reward. It will also show the consolidation
                           fees as the costs for a '<em>Payment to yourself</em>'.</i>

                        switch to the Console tab and type: <span class="monocolored-small">importaddress <i>address</i></span></i>, where <em>address</em> is the consolidation

                    <div class="smallheading">Note on share management</div>
                    Everyone's shares will decrease by 90% if the pool finds a block<br />
                    (except when multiple blocks are found within a small amount of time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shares decrease by 5% whenever anyone finds a new block on the network<br />
                    (this happens more or less every 41 seconds).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Workers under the minimum share floor of 8 shares don't get paid,<br />
                    but are also not affected by the 5% share decrease<br />
                    (this to decrease the amount of dust the pool is generating somewhat).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is all part of the payout management logic in order to keep payout fair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that this does not mean that the pool takes a fee by decreasing worker shares,<br />
                    as shares are the only thing on which block reward payout is based. Rather,<br />
                    this is a way to get workers that stopped mining slowly out of the system<br />
                    while still giving them something for their work.<br />
                    It also helps new workers joining to pool to get a little bit extra in times<br />
                    where the pool is unlucky and can't find a block for a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These numbers might change in the future.
