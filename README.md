# FreshGRLC.net / FreshGarlicBlocks Website

This is the online repository of the client-side (HTML, CSS, JS) code of the FreshGRLC.net website.

This repository is intended to be used by people who want to help contribute to make the website look or work better, as I am not much of a web developer myself.
